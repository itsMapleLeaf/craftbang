# Welcome to CraftBang!

CraftBang is a multitasking desktop environment for ComputerCraft's CraftOS, a program aiming for productivity and convenience. The name and color scheme are both based off of the wonderful CrunchBang linux, and CraftBang is compatible with both advanced and normal computers.

Any files placed in the /autorun directory will be run by craftbang automatically, each as its own task.


## Installation

Simply download the "updater" file from this page, or from pastebin:

    pastebin get reBqWcFr updater

and run it on your computer. It will download the installer, which will download craftbang files and prompt you for running on startup. You need to have HTTP enabled.


## The Panel

Create a new task by right-clicking the desktop and choosing "Run..", or by double-clicking a desktop shortcut. All tasks are sized to fit the panel.

Left-click to toggle a task.  
Left-click and drag to move a task around on the panel.  
Right-click or middle-click to close a task on the panel.

When a task ends, its name will have an [X] in front of it, and you are free to close it.


## The Desktop

Right-click the desktop to bring up the main menu. From there, you can run a program, create a new desktop shortcut, restart or shut down the computer, or exit CraftBang and return to the normal CraftOS shell.

Double-click an icon to run it.  
Left-click and drag to move it around.  
Right-click the icon to rename or remove it.
